README for Designers Default
------------------------------------------------

Designers Default is a theme based on Michael Heilemann's default wordpress theme included with Wordpress out of the box. After doing lots of wordpress development, I found myself having to change the same things over and over again and reorganizing the structure and styles over and over again. This theme is really just a compilation of all those changes so I can start with a clean base. I am making it available to the public as I hope someone else may find it useful.
